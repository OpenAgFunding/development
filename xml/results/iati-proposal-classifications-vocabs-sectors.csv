6;;Private Sector Development;"The programme will have three key outputs
•	Output 1: Improved policy and regulatory environment for MSE finance. The centre- piece of this activity will be the establishment of a ‘Policy Forum’ that brings together the main regulatory bodies, enabling institutions and private sector actors to discuss policy issues, consider the implications of evidence originating from research and improve coordination. 
•	Output 2: Increased access to appropriate, market based, business services for MSEs This intervention will use a challenge fund approach to encourage Business Development Service (BDS) providers & financial institutions (e.g. banks) to design innovative models to offer support services to MSEs that improve their ability to access finance. 
•	Output 3: Increased product, delivery channel, and business model innovation by banks and MFIs. This is a broader component looking at both banks and MFIs through two distinct instruments: the challenge fund and the credit guarantee fund."
