US-1-TZ-50-AID-621-TO-11-05000,U.S. Agency for International Development,US-1,10,0,Tanzania Staples Value Chain (NAFAKA),"The NAFAKA Staples Value Chain Activity is a five-year Task Order issued by USAID under the Tanzania Feed the Future (FtF) Initiative and administered by ACDI/VOCA. NAFAKA integrates agricultural, gender, environment and nutritional development efforts to improve smallholder farmer productivity and profitability within the rice and maize value chains in Morogoro (Kilombero and Mvomero Districts), Dodoma (Kongwa District) and Manyara (Kiteto District) on the mainland, as well as Pemba and Unguja in Zanzibar. NAFAKA’s goal is to sustainably reduce poverty and food insecurity by increasing incomes for smallholder farmers, including men, women, and youth.
 
NAFAKA aligns with the Feed the Future (FtF) goal to harmonize regional hunger- and poverty-fighting efforts in countries with chronic food insecurity and insufficient production of staple crops. NAFAKA works with rural communities and the Government of Tanzania to analyze the local rice and maize value chains and to develop strategies to strengthen them. NAFAKA represents a commitment to Tanzania’s country-led Kilimo Kwanza initiative to reinvigorate agricultural growth emerging from the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) process.",en,1,2,en,USD,2011-04-08,2,USA,US-USAGOV,10,1,TZ,,100,,,1,10,110,C01,5,31161,100,1,http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm,"NAFAKA Staples Value Chain Activity: Annual Performance Report (October 1, 2014 – September 30, 2015)",http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pa00ks35.pdf,A07,en,application/pdf,2015-09-30,1,2011-04-08,2012-04-07,3000000,USD,2011-04-08,2,2011-04-08,34800000,USD,2011-04-08,,U.S. Agency for International Development,10,US-1,ACDI/VOCA,21,US-EIN-52-0811461,US-1-TZ-50-AID-621-TO-11-05000,US-EIN-13-3287064NAM-ACDI-TZ-11-2780,31161,1,http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/dacandcrscodelists.htm,?,2,0503,G1,Kilombero District,"Kilombero District, Morogoro","Kilombero District: a paddy-growing area in the south of the Morogoro region with five clusters.
