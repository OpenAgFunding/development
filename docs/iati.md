The [International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard](http://iatistandard.org/) provides a common data format, used by [100s of organizations](https://www.iatiregistry.org/), to describe **activities**, their **funding** and their **goals and outcomes**. 

Although originally developed for aid transparency, the IATI standard can be used to represent a wide range of funding flows, including grants, loans and investments. 

The Open Ag Funding framework extends the IATI standard by:

* Identifying [20 key elements](framework.md) that **must** or **should** be included to give a clear picture of funding for agricultural development and food security;
* Setting out the vocabularies to use for classifying activities;
* Providing guidance on how to prepare information on partners, locations and results information for each activity.

**If you already use IATI** then adopting the Open Ag Funding framework will involve checking your data quality, and adding or enhancing information for agriculture-related activities. 

**If you are new to IATI** then you can choose to publish full IATI data, or you can use our [simplified spreadsheet template](TODO PAGE AND LINKS) to prepare your Open Ag Funding data.
