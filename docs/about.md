The [Initiative for Open Ag Funding](https://www.interaction.org/project/open-ag-funding/overview) is working to make sure that development actors working in agriculture and food security have the data they need to make smarter investment decisions, and to ultimately end hunger and food insecurity.

## The Open Ag Funding data framework
On this site you can find out **how to publish and use Open Ag Funding data** that is fit for purpose to support donor co-ordination and more effective use of resources for agricultural development and food security. 

You can: 

* Read more about [how we are building on the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data standard](iati.md);
* Explore the 20 data elements needed for effective Open Ag Funding data;
* View the technical documentation on how to prepare your data in XML or spreadsheet formats; 
* Read background research from the project



## Share your data

**Does your organization provides funding for agricultural development or food security?** If so -  we need your data. 

If you already publish data using the IATI standard, you can enhance your existing data to make it Open Ag ready. 

If you do not currently publish structured data on your funding or investments, you can [follow these simple steps to plan out new open data publication](ADD LINK ADD LINKS).  

Not sure why you would share your data? Read more here about the benefits.

Looking for support to publish? We're offering free publisher support during 2017. 

## Explore Open Ag Funding Data

Over 2017 we will be supporting the development of a range of tools that can  help you explore and analyze data published according to the Open Ag Funding framework. 

Check back for details of tools here later in 2017, or [get in touch](contact.md) to let us know about the data analysis you want to be able to carry out, and we'll see if we can signpost you to existing resources.
