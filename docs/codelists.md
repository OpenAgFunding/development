Codelists
=========

The most widely used codelist for classifying aid activities and investments (the OECD DAC CRS Purpose codes) does not provide enough specificity when it comes to agriculture and food security. 

As a result, the [Open Ag Funding framework](framework.md) asks funders to provide additional activity classification using a detailed agricultural vocabulary.

> This page will be updated following the tool development workshop, and final confirmation of codelist to be used. 

The two candidate classifications for this are:

* GACS - the General Agricultural Concept Scheme;

and 

* AGROVOC - The Agricultural Vocabulary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation

These are both ontologies, and cross-walks exist between them. This means that they contain structured terms, allowing funders to choose the level of detail to classify their activities to.
