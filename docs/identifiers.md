Identifiers
===========

When publishing Open Ag Funding data, two identifiers are particularly important.

### Activity identifier

Each activity should be given a stable identifier, following the IATI guidance on activity IDs. You can [read more about this on the framework pages](framework.md).

### Organisation identifiers

> Additional guidance will be included here from the Idenfify Org project
